                    Hi! I'm Jon Leyshon, I currently work as a speech and language therapy assistant in the National Health Service in the UK but am training to be a software engineer through the full stack engineer path on Codeacademy.
                    <br>
                    I have been practising software engineering for around a year and am loving every minute of it. If you would like to meet virtually to discuss a potential joint project then check out my contact me page and message me on github.
